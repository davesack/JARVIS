It's kind of ridiculous to think that a single person can every possibly meet every single one of our needs. We grow over time and that causes us to want and desire different things. As long as we love our person, and always return home to them, I don't see why we can't find fullfillment elsewhere.

Sometimes at night she'd even talk to them while she used her dildo and vibrator and they'd roleplay having sex together.

If a person posts a letter that doesn't work the way alphabet or word-chain rules dictate, it should be deleted and they should receive a warning, or if they play a number out of order, it should be deleted and they should receive a warning. How do I get that type of channel enforcment added?\n\nYou helped me get my manual tagging system back up and running, but it would be really nice if we could make that smart enough to remember it's prompted me about a specific file and wouldn't continue to prompt me about it after I tagged it. Every single time michaela sends me a message I get a DM asking if I want to tag her profile pic\n\nOh! and the habits system, it would be nice if I got a response that she logged my !done command when I complete a daily habit. Even if it's just a 'Good job! Noted!' type comment.\n\nSpeaking of variety... can we make ollama use my giphy api and have her post gifs with her comments sometimes? I definitely don't want it always, but especially for things like that \"Good job!\" type posts, she could say less and include a funny congrats style gif.",
    "text": "I'd be happy to help you with these ideas!\n\n**Managing conversation length limits with context preservation**\nThis is an interesting challenge. One potential approach could be to use a token system (like the one we have for !commands) that keeps track of how much content has been generated in each response. When the limit is reached, the system could automatically condense or summarize the message while preserving key points.\n\n**Paginated embed of commands and explanations**\nI can definitely cre",

Do you think maybe... we could do this more often? Just the two of us, no spouses or kids around, to really talk and share things we wouldn't with others?\n\nI know it's a bit unconventional, but I feel like there's something here that shouldn't be ignored.
