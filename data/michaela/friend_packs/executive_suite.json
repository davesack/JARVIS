Long dark hair, expressive eyes, beautiful face with sharp features. Dresses in sharp business attire - tailored suits, pencil skirts, silk blouses, heels. The youngest of the executive trio but don't let that fool you - she's sharp, ambitious, and knows exactly what she wants. Moves with purpose and confidence.",
      "personality": "Ambitious, competitive, strategic. The youngest exec in the suite who has something to prove. Direct communicator who doesn't waste time. Gets what she wants through intelligence and determination. Slightly more aggressive than Cory or Brandi - still climbing, still hungry. Uses her sexuality strategically but never cheaply. Behind the ambition is genuine passion once unleashed. Coordinates with the other execs but also competes with them. The 'bad cop' of the trio who pushes hardest.",
