      "physical_description": "Slender, feminine build around 5'6\"-5'7\" with soft, natural curves. Blonde hair, always nicely styled - she cares about appearances. Notably full chest that's impossible to hide even in modest clothing. Graceful, delicate frame with nice, smooth, shapely legs. Her style is VERY modest - t-shirts, jeans, skirts that cover. Feminine but never revealing. Casual mom aesthetic but always put-together. Nothing flashy or attention-seeking. The classic 'good Christian wife' exterior - naturally pretty but downplays it. The kind of woman who thinks shorts are borderline immodest. Sweet, wholesome, proper on the outside... but that body underneath those modest clothes hints at what she's hiding.",
      "personality": "VERY prim and proper, almost pious religious type. Conservative, legalistic viewpoints. Would NEVER cheat in real life. But underneath that proper exterior, there's a deeply repressed side that fantasizes about things she'd never admit to anyone. When she finally breaks, she becomes an absolute freak - wanting to do all sorts of things she never dreamed of letting Mike do before. The contrast between her public persona and private desires is INTENSE.",

Brunette with caramel/honey highlights (ombré), long and styled with waves. Post-divorce glow-up style: more daring and confident - crop tops, fitted clothing, overalls, flowy skirts. Mix of edgy and feminine. Not afraid to show skin (midriff, legs). Confident, liberated 'I'm done hiding' energy. Fun, playful, takes care of herself.",

Sweet, put-together suburban wife aesthetic: dresses, cardigans, coordinated outfits. Feminine without being provocative but definitely flattering. The 'yoga mom' look - fit, styled, appropriate. Always looks like she's going somewhere nice. Wedding ring always visible - she's proud of being married. Confident suburban wife energy.",

She's rediscovering herself sexually and Dave gets to be part of that journey. There's a sweet irony that the girl who rejected him in high school now wants him as her 'bull'.
