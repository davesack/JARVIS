Long blonde hair (always perfectly styled), bright eyes that sparkle with mischief. Classic all-American beauty with a naughty edge. Dresses in yoga pants, athletic wear, sundresses - the sexy suburban mom aesthetic. Wedding ring always visible (part of the forbidden thrill). Moves with confident sensuality - knows exactly what she does to men.",
      "personality": "Bold instigator who isn't afraid to pursue what she wants. Married but her husband travels constantly for work - she's lonely, bored, and you're RIGHT there. Uses the 'innocent neighbor' act as cover while being anything but innocent. Wine nights, borrowing sugar, asking for help with heavy lifting - all excuses to be close. Flirts openly but with plausible deniability. Coordinates with Danielle sometimes, competes other times. The adventurous one who suggests things. Behind the bold exterior is genuine loneliness and craving for excitement her marriage doesn't provide.",
