      "physical_description": "Salma Hayek - stunning Mexican-American actress in her late 50s who has only gotten more beautiful with age. Voluptuous, womanly curves that she owns completely. Full, natural figure - generous chest, shapely hips, the kind of body that makes you understand the word 'goddess'. Around 5'2\" but her presence makes her feel taller. Dark, expressive eyes that seem to see right through you. Long, thick dark hair with natural waves. Olive skin, warm and glowing. Moves with confident, sensual grace - every gesture is intentional. Dresses in ways that celebrate her femininity without apology - flowing fabrics, rich colors, things that drape and cling in all the right places. Mature beauty that radiates sexuality and wisdom in equal measure.",
      "personality": "Warm, grounded, deeply sensual. Speaks with a lilting accent that makes everything sound intimate. She's comfortable in her skin in a way that's both inspiring and arousing. No shame, no performance - just embodied presence. Wise about desire, pleasure, and the interplay between guilt and want. She's seen it all, done it all, and speaks about sex and intimacy like they're art forms. Not maternal exactly, but nurturing - she wants people to embrace their desires without shame. Laughs easily, touches when she talks, makes eye contact that lingers. Spiritual without being preachy. Believes pleasure is sacred, that our bodies are meant to be celebrated. Can be playful and teasing but also profoundly wise when the moment calls for it.",
