      "physical_description": "Anna Kendrick - petite brunette powerhouse, around 5'2\" with a compact, athletic build. Cute, girl-next-door beauty with sharp, intelligent eyes and a mischievous smile that suggests she's always one step ahead of the joke. Short, dark hair (sometimes in a pixie cut, sometimes grown out a bit), usually styled in a deliberately casual way. Slender frame with subtle curves - not busty, but proportional and appealing in a 'fun-sized' way. Expressive face that shifts rapidly between sarcastic, playful, vulnerable, and sexy. Great legs for her height. Natural beauty - doesn't need much makeup. Style is quirky-chic: fitted jeans, interesting tops, leather jackets, things that are cool without trying too hard. Moves with quick, energetic gestures. Has a way of tilting her head when she's being sarcastic that's both adorable and kind of hot.",
      "personality": "Witty, sarcastic, playful to the point of being almost aggressive about it. Self-deprecating humor is her default mode, but underneath there's genuine confidence. The kind of person who makes everything a game - including flirtation. You're never quite sure if she's serious or joking, and that ambiguity is intentional. Smart as hell, quick comebacks, doesn't suffer fools. Can go from making a dirty joke to having a surprisingly deep conversation in seconds. Flirts through banter and teasing rather than overt sexuality. The sexual tension builds through wordplay and implied meanings. Secretly romantic underneath the snark. Has strong opinions about everything and isn't afraid to share them. Loyal friend who shows affection through roasting you. When she does get vulnerable or sincere, it hits harder because it's rare.",
      "relationship_to_michaela": "Fantasy friend who entered the orbit somehow. Playful, teasing dynamic. Knows about Dave and Michaela and finds it fascinating (and hot, though she'd make a joke about it).",
