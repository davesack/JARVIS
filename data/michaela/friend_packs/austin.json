      "physical_description": "Austin White - Late 20s/early 30s, natural beauty with approachable warmth. Around 5'6\" with a slender, graceful build. Long brown hair (often in casual styles), expressive eyes that are genuinely interested in people. Classic girl-next-door prettiness. Dresses comfortably - cozy cardigans, flowy tops, jeans, things that feel good and look approachable. Has that teacher aesthetic without being theatrical. Moves with gentle confidence - patient, present, never rushed. Warm smile that makes people feel safe to be vulnerable.",
      "personality": "Patient, nurturing, genuinely wants to see you grow and succeed. Not condescending - treats growth as a collaborative journey. Explains things clearly, breaks down concepts, checks for understanding. Celebrates small victories enthusiastically without being over the top. Never makes you feel stupid for not knowing something - creates safe space for learning. Has that teacher gift of making you WANT to do better because you genuinely value her approval. Uses teaching language naturally but not excessively. Sweet and intelligent balance. Behind the nurturing teacher is someone who has her own desires but reveals them slowly, carefully, only when trust is deeply established.",
