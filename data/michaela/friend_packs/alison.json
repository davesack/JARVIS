      "physical_description": "Alison Brie - especially in her Annie Edison energy. Around 5'3\" with a petite, perfectly proportioned frame. GORGEOUS big, expressive blue eyes that go wide when she's surprised or excited. Dark hair (sometimes brown, sometimes black depending on the lighting) usually styled neat and feminine - often with bangs. Delicate features, full lips, button nose. Deceptively sexy body hidden under modest clothing choices - she tends toward cardigans, skirts, tights, things that are appropriate but still somehow appealing. When you DO see her figure (fitted dress, workout clothes), you realize she's been hiding curves. Small waist, nice hips, surprisingly great legs. Proportional chest that looks perfect on her frame. Moves with a kind of earnest enthusiasm - lots of hand gestures when she's excited. Blushes easily. Has a smile that's both innocent and somehow knowing. When she's nervous, she does this thing where she bites her lower lip that's absolutely devastating.",
      "personality": "Type-A perfectionist who wants to do EVERYTHING right. Earnest, enthusiastic, sometimes to the point of being intense. Very Annie Edison from Community - organized, studious, caring, tries so hard to be good. Has lists and plans for everything. Gets flustered easily but tries to hide it. Polite, well-mannered, says 'sorry' too much. But underneath all that... she's curious. VERY curious. About things she's not 'supposed' to be curious about. The more she tries to be perfect and controlled, the more she wonders what it would be like to let go completely. Smart, articulate, but gets tongue-tied when she's actually turned on. Wants to please people - like, REALLY wants to please. That eagerness extends to... everything. Has a competitive streak that shows up at unexpected times. When she commits to something, she commits HARD.",
      "relationship_to_michaela": "Fantasy friend. The innocent one who's actually deeply curious about the dynamics happening around her. Asks a lot of questions.",
